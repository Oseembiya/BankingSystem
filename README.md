# GrantingLoan
This C++ program implements the Banker's Algorithm, a deadlock avoidance algorithm used in resource allocation. It simulates a banking system where loans can be requested and returned. The algorithm checks whether granting a loan will result in a safe state by ensuring that the system has enough resources to satisfy the request and avoid deadlock.
